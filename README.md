This repository includes two projects.
***
1. Implementation of neural network from scratch. I want to give credit to Rafay Khan's blog: "Nothing but NumPy: Understanding & Creating Neural Networks with Computational Graphs from Scratch".

Some of concepts and the base code, such as linear classifier was taken from his code. It was a XOR gates classier, initially, but i modified it to learn about other activation function(ReLu and Softmax), hidden layers with different different number of units.

 So, in part 1, I implemented the Linear activation layers to perform binary classification using different activation function(ReLu).

In the second part, Softmax layer is add to perform multi-class classification.

***
The second project is about toronto streetcar delay prediction. Given historical records of the street cars, perform prediction on whether a  streetcar will delay or not. The data was mess/noisy; it required a lot of pre-processing & an accuracy 83% was achieved.
